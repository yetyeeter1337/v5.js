# v5.js
a whole bunch of somewhat random utilities for p5.js intended to make creating games and art easier

# what the heck is this??
a library which is the culmination of all the random backend stuff I've made in my time messing around with p5.js
I use this in a lot of my projects
if you can figure out how to use it, feel free to, I put this under GPL for a reason :D

# what does it add?
- time values (in seconds)
- timers
- a modular button/slider/dial system (which can be found standalone at https://github.com/yetyeeter1337/p5.Modbuttons)
- flicker controllers
- delayed execution (although you could probably just use a timeout)
- a joint system (puppeteer) (a little janky since I made it a few years ago)
- 2D vector math and line intersection (basically 2D raycasting)
- TransValue class, made for tweening values over time

and maybe more stuff if I need it

# how do I use it?
download and import the v5.js file into your p5.js project
